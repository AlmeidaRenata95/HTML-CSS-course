  <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
  <p>
    HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It's a markup language that web developers use to
    structure and describe
    the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML consists of elements that describe different types ofss content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
    etc.
    Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
  </p>
  <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

  <ol>
    <!--o navegador renderiza as listas da forma ordenada, mesmo se ocorrer a inclusao de mais um item lista. o significado Ã© ter uma estrutura de forma logica-->
    <li>First </li>
    <li>The opening tag</li>
    <li>The closing tag</li>
    <li>The actual element</li>
  </ol>

  You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.
